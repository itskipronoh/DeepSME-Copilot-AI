## The Problem I Am Solving

Small and Micro-Enterprises (SMEs) in Africa face significant challenges in accessing reliable business guidance, financial literacy support, and compliance information. Specifically:

### **Financial Literacy Challenges**

- Limited access to bookkeeping and tax guidance
- Difficulty understanding KRA tax returns and NHIF/NSSF contributions
- Lack of knowledge about loan records and invoice management

### **Compliance and Regulatory Barriers**

- Complex Kenyan business registration processes
- Confusing permit requirements and renewal procedures
- Limited understanding of cooperative registration with Ministry of Co-operatives

### **Business Growth Obstacles**

- Insufficient knowledge about financing options (KEJET, NYOTA, Financial Inclusion Fund)
- Poor customer service and grievance handling practices
- Limited understanding of digital payment systems (M-Pesa, banking)
- Lack of awareness about savings groups (chamas) and SACCOs

### **Information Access Issues**

- Scattered information across multiple government agencies
- Language barriers in official documentation
- Limited internet connectivity for research
- Cost of professional business consultancy

**DeepSME Copilot addresses these challenges by providing an AI-powered assistant that offers instant, practical guidance in simple language, backed by official Kenyan SME resources.**

> You can test this application locally without any cost using [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Follow the instructions in the [Local Development](#local-development) section to get started.

## Overview

Building AI applications can be complex and time-consuming, but using LangChain.js and Azure serverless technologies allows me to greatly simplify the process. This application is a chatbot that uses a set of SME-focused documents to generate responses to business queries.

I provide sample data focused on African SME challenges to make this ready to try, but feel free to replace it with your own. I focus on **Kenyan Small and Micro-Enterprises**, and the experience allows business owners to ask questions about compliance, financing, tax guidance, and business development. The sample data includes documents from MSEA, KEJET, NYOTA, and other relevant Kenyan business resources.

</div>

This application is made from multiple components:

- A web app made with a single chat web component built with [Lit](https://lit.dev) and hosted on [Azure Static Web Apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/overview). The code is located in the `packages/webapp` folder.

- A serverless API built with [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview?pivots=programming-language-javascript) and using [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/) to ingest SME-focused documents and generate responses to business queries. The code is located in the `packages/api` folder.

- A database to store chat sessions and the text extracted from business documents and the vectors generated by LangChain.js, using [Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/).

- A file storage to store the source SME documents, using [Azure Blob Storage](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction).

I use the [HTTP protocol for AI chat apps](https://aka.ms/chatprotocol) to communicate between the web app and the API.

## Why I Picked This Template

I chose the **Azure Serverless AI Chat with RAG using LangChain.js** template because it provides:
